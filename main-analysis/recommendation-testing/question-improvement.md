Here’s how you can turn those prompts into **logic-based, fully dynamic questions**—exactly in line with the PRD’s requirements:

---

## 1. Define Your Question Schema

Every question your bot emits should conform to a small JSON schema:

```jsonc
{
  "id":         "budget",                     // unique key
  "type":       "single-select"|"multi-select"|"numeric",  
  "text":       "What’s your travel budget per person?",
  "options":    [                            // for select-type only
     { "value": 300,  "label": "$300–500" },
     { "value": 500,  "label": "$500–1000" },
     … 
     { "value": null, "label": "Custom amount" }
  ],
  "placeholder": "Enter a number",           // for numeric-type
  "validation": {                            // basic checks
     "min": 1,
     "max": 100000
  }
}
```

---

## 2. Classify Your Example Questions

| Prompt                                      | `type`          | Notes                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **“What’s your travel budget per person?”** | `single-select` | Pre-defined ranges + “Custom”     |
| **“How long would you like to travel?”**    | `single-select` | Durations in days/weeks           |
| **“Which experiences interest you most…”**  | `multi-select`  | User can pick multiple categories |

If you add a **custom amount** flow (e.g. user types “500”), you switch to:

```jsonc
{
  "id":     "budget_custom",
  "type":   "numeric",
  "text":   "Please enter your exact budget in taka:",
  "validation": { "min": 1, "max": 1000000 }
}
```

## 3. Embed Your Business Logic

In your backend (or inside your LLM-prompt chain) you maintain a small **rule engine** that:

1. **Reads** the user’s previous answer(s).
2. **Filters** the next question’s `options` according to those rules.
3. **Emits** exactly one new question object.

### Example Rule: Budget ↦ Duration

```js
function getDurationOptions(budget) {
  if (budget < 1000) 
    return [
      { value: 1, label: "1 day trip" },
      { value: 2, label: "2–3 days" }
    ];
  else if (budget < 5000)
    return [
      { value: 1, label: "1 day trip" },
      { value: 2, label: "2–3 days" },
      { value: 4, label: "4–5 days" }
    ];
  else
    return [
      { value: 1, label: "1 day trip" },
      { value: 2, label: "2–3 days" },
      { value: 4, label: "4–5 days" },
      { value: 7, label: "One week" }
    ];
}
```

When the user answers **budget = 500**, your code does:

```js
const opts = getDurationOptions(500); 
// [{1,"1 day"},{"2,"2–3 days"}]
emitQuestion({ id:"duration", type:"single-select", text:"How long…?", options:opts });
```

---

## 4. Orchestrate via LLM + Prompt Engineering

If you’d rather have an LLM drive it end-to-end, you can:

1. **Prompt** the LLM with:

   > “User budget = `500` taka.
   > Return the **next question** as JSON,
   > using only durations they can actually afford,
   > in this schema: `{id,type,text,options}`.”

2. The LLM replies:

   ```json
   {
     "id":       "duration",
     "type":     "single-select",
     "text":     "Given your budget of 500 taka, how many days can you travel?",
     "options": [
       { "value": 1, "label": "1 day" },
       { "value": 2, "label": "2 days" },
       { "value": 3, "label": "3 days" }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Parse** that JSON and render it in your chat UI.

## 5. Tie It All Together

* **Step 1**: Emit the **budget** question (`single-select` + custom).
* **Step 2**: When answer arrives, run your rule (or LLM prompt) to generate **duration**.
* **Step 3**: After **duration**, you can similarly drive **experience** questions, or any further logic branches based on budget × duration.

### Key Takeaways

* **Schema-first**: Always structure questions as JSON.
* **Rule-based or LLM-driven**: Either hard-code your business rules (fast, transparent) or push them into an LLM prompt (more flexible).
* **Logic at every step**: Each new question “knows” the user’s prior answers and only offers valid, affordable options.
* **Highly optimized**: Keep rules simple and cacheable; prompt the LLM with minimal context for speed and cost-control.

With that in place, your dynamic questionnaire will seamlessly adapt to **any** budget, duration or preference—and stay fully aligned with the TasteJourney PRD.
