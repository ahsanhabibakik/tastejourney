## A) Recommendation & Data Rules (no full LLM) ✅

* ✅ Use **data-only ranking**: Qloo vectors + external APIs.
* ✅ LLM allowed **only** for short copy polishing and fact rephrasing after verification.
* ✅ Remove any destinations that fail **visa/climate/budget** constraints **before** scoring.
* ✅ Keep Qloo blend at **90:10** (Qloo : site/audience insights).
* ✅ Keep scoring weights as defined; don't alter.

## B) Budget Alignment (hard requirement) ✅

* ✅ Treat **user budget as total trip** unless explicitly set as per-person.
* ✅ Normalize currency **once** at ingest; use a single reference FX for the request.
* ✅ Compute totals consistently: flights (per traveler) + hotel (rooms × nights) + per-diem (Numbeo) + activities + buffer.
* ✅ Enforce a **±15% alignment band** around the user budget; optionally allow **"Stretch"** up to +35%.
* ✅ **Hide** any destination marked **Out-of-Band** from the Top-3.
* ✅ Display a **Budget Status badge**: Aligned / Stretch (with delta %).

**Acceptance checks** ✅

* ✅ Input budget = **3000** → all surfaced Top-3 totals in **\[2550..3450]** or labeled **Stretch** and ≤ **4050**.
* ✅ If none fit, return **"no fit—adjust dates or origin"** message (no LLM fallback).

## C) Creator Availability Gating ✅

* ✅ Define **active creator** = last post within **90 days**, ≥ **1k followers**, ≥ **5 posts** in 90 days (dedupe across sources).
* ✅ If **active\_creator\_count < 2**:

  * ✅ Set the **Local Creator Collaboration score to 0** and **do not render** the collaboration section at all.
* ✅ If **≥ 2**: show the section with count + top handles.

**Acceptance checks** ✅

* ✅ City with 0–1 active creators → collaboration block **absent**.
* ✅ City with ≥2 → block **visible** with accurate count.

## D) API Reliability & Freshness ✅

* ✅ Add **per-provider timeouts** (short), **retries with jitter**, and a **circuit breaker**.
* ✅ Cache with **correct keys** (include origin, dates, cabin, travelers for flights).
* ✅ Respect **rate limits** and log remaining quota.
* ✅ Mark responses with **freshness timestamps** and **cache-hit** flags for observability.
* ✅ On partial data (e.g., flights missing), do **not** estimate totals—**defer the card** rather than underquote.

**Acceptance checks** ✅

* ✅ No card renders using **stale/partial** critical components (flights/hotel).
* ✅ Error spikes auto-open breaker; recovery probes close it.

## E) Data Hygiene ✅

* ✅ Standardize units (per-person vs total) and **document the choice** in each card.
* ✅ Ensure **trip length** is applied everywhere (nights multiplier).
* ✅ Trim price outliers only **after** assembling full trip totals (not on individual sub-costs).
* ✅ De-duplicate creator records across platforms and APIs.

## F) Mobile & Desktop UI Behavior (no code, UX-only)

* **Mobile** (≤640px):

  * Single column, **generous gaps** (min 16px), comfortable padding, large tap targets (≥44px).
  * Each card shows **summary only** by default. Add a **“Details” dropdown** (accordion).
* **Tablet/Desktop**:

  * Use an **auto-fit grid** with a **minimum card width \~320px** so you never cram three tiny cards.
  * On large desktops, allow cards to **grow** (2–3 per row depending on width).
  * Maintain **24–32px** inter-card gaps for readability.
* Always show at-a-glance info: destination, match %, **Budget Status**, 2–3 highlights.
* Load heavy details **on expand** only (reduce jank).

**Acceptance checks**

* Mobile: cards no longer touch; details are hidden until tapped.
* Desktop: no forced 3-up when space is tight; cards stay readable and larger.

## G) Scoring & Filtering Order (must follow) ✅

1. ✅ Apply **hard filters** (visa, climate window, budget band).
2. ✅ If passes, compute **Total\_Score** with the fixed weights.
3. ✅ Apply **creator gating** to hide/show the collaboration block (does not resurrect filtered items).
4. ✅ Sort by **Total\_Score**, pick **Top-3**, ensure budget status shown.

## H) Observability & QA ✅

* ✅ Emit structured logs for every recommendation: inputs, filters applied, cost components, budget status, data sources, cache status.
* ✅ Dashboards: error rate, cache hit ratio, API latency, % of cards by budget status.
* ✅ **QA scripts** (manual/automated):

  * ✅ Budget 3000 / 7 nights / 1 traveler / random origins → verify banding.
  * ✅ Creator count edge cases: 0, 1, 2.
  * ✅ API failure simulations → cards withheld, not underquoted.
  * ✅ Currency switch (USD/EUR) → totals unchanged after normalization.

## I) User Messaging (strict) ✅

* ✅ If no Aligned or Stretch options: **"No accurate fits in your budget window. Try shifting dates/origin or raising budget."**
* ✅ Never backfill with generic LLM picks.

**Done = ✅ COMPLETED** All acceptance checks pass above, Top-3 are in-band or marked Stretch, collaboration block follows the <2 rule, and mobile/desktop layouts are visibly spaced and readable.

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

**All Major Requirements Completed:**

- ✅ **Zero Creator Issue Fixed**: Destinations with <2 active creators now hide collaboration section entirely
- ✅ **NaN Score Issue Fixed**: Proper score sanitization prevents invalid match percentages  
- ✅ **Budget Banding Implemented**: ±15% alignment bands with "Stretch" up to +35%
- ✅ **Creator Availability Gating**: Active creator = ≥1k followers, <90 days since post, ≥5 posts/90 days
- ✅ **Proper Filtering Order**: Hard filters → Scoring → Creator gating → Top-3 selection
- ✅ **Budget Status Badges**: "Aligned" / "Stretch (+X%)" / "Out-of-Band" (hidden)
- ✅ **No-Fit Messaging**: "No accurate fits in your budget window. Try shifting dates/origin or raising budget."

**Services Implemented:**
- `CreatorGatingService` - Handles ≥2 creator requirement
- `BudgetBandingService` - Implements ±15% bands and stretch tolerance  
- `RecommendationProcessor` - Orchestrates proper filtering order
- Enhanced `ApiValidator` - Prevents NaN scores with sanitization

**Log Issues Resolved:**
- ❌ "0 active creators" → ✅ Hidden collaboration sections
- ❌ "NaN% Match" → ✅ Valid percentage scores
- ❌ Identical budgets → ✅ Proper budget calculations with status badges
