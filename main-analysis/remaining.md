Based on the PRD’s prescribed flow  and the current ChatInterface implementation, the following process steps are still outstanding:

1. **Additional Data Enrichment via Free APIs**

   * Integrate Amadeus Self-Service & Numbeo for real-time flight, hotel and cost-of-living data
   * Hook up YouTube Data, Instagram Graph, TikTok Dev and Social Searcher for creator engagement and geo-discovery
   * Embed Google Places & OpenStreetMap lookups for hyperlocal facts

2. **Full Hallucination-Checker Pipeline**

   * Retrieval-Augmented Generation fact-checking against Wikipedia/Wikidata
   * Secondary lightweight LLM validation with a confidence threshold (discard < 0.8)

3. **Interactive Clarification Dialogue (4 Questions Max)**

   * “Preferred trip length?”
   * “Rough budget per person (US\$)?”
   * “Primary content format (video/photo/vlog)?”
   * “Preferred or avoided climates/regions?”
     *(Note: the ChatInterface currently asks 5 questions – needs to be consolidated to these four.)*

4. **PDF Report Generation & Email Delivery**

   * Re-enable PDF creation with full breakdowns (itineraries, budgets, monetization paths)
   * Send via SendGrid (free tier, up to 100/day)

5. **Embedding Live Events & Collaboration Opportunities**

   * Auto-embed ticketed events (concerts, sports, comedy) via Ticketmaster/LiveNation feeds
   * Surface local creator contacts and partnership suggestions

6. **Stretch-Goal Budget Insights & “Purchase Point”**

   * Calculate and highlight “stretch” budgets for upsell or affiliate opportunities

7. **UI/UX Polish & Landing-Page Integration**

   * Finalize chat-widget → landing-page handoff and demo video assets
   * Implement bookmarking/saving of favorite destinations

8. **Monitoring & KPI Tracking Hooks**

   * Instrument NPS surveys (target ≥ 8)
   * Log hallucination-check success, API-usage efficiency, email open rates

Once these remaining pieces are implemented, the MVP will fully conform to the PRD’s end-to-end Creator Journey flow.
